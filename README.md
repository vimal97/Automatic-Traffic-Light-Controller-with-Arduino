# Automatic-Traffic-Light-Controller-with-Arduino

Traffic congestion is a severe problem in most of the cities across the world. It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signaling etc.
This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction.
